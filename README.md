# About Me

Here I have a few projects of games I'm working on, such as **DOOM Unity** and a completely new game called **TerraFabric**. TerraFabric is based on classic Minecraft mods like Industrial Craft and Galactic Craft, but it uses voxel blocks and is being made entirely from scratch as a way to learn and as a source of enjoyment.
