## TerraFabric

This is a project that i'm doing in cooperation with [brenulevi](https://github.com/brenulevi, its a survival game called **TerraFabric** based on the classic mods from the game Minecraft, in especial Industrial Craft and Galatic Craft, that uses voxel blocks and is being made entirely from scratch as a way to learn and as a source o enjoyment, we're currently at the firsts builds but we expect to make a functional build someday hopefully =).
